# My GraphQL Setup

Here's a diagram showing how the client interacts with a GraphQL API:

"Less is more" a recognized phrase that is used frequently with things that could be easy 
but with our primitive behavior (as developers) we complicate it. Hated or loved, 
it's always an interesting topic talking or getting out of a traditional REST architecture 
to dive deep on other stuff, more developer friendly. In my opinion, GraphQL could be complicated
at first. Nonetheless, once your project is ready it's magical to see how things are connected and
how easy is to get data.
